\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
We enjoyed this project a lot, because it was an interesting application of the theory learned in the course Automata and Formal Language. We further had a chance to look into how JavaCC works. It was nice to have a direct visualization at the end of the project. The workload was quite a lot also because working with JavaCC was a bit tricky at first.
